Dear Vietnam Australia International School,

Greetings!

My name is Liza May Adiwang and I am the Account Manager of Tim Corp, a company that specializes in Food & Beverage solutions. I have also reached out to you via the hotline 02836220898 and looking forward to be connected by Zalo.

At Tim Corp, there's a special facility called Choco Lab where students and adults alike can experience a unique, fun, and engaging chocolate-making workshop that definitely brings excitement and knowledge to everyone.

With this, we would like to extend a warm invitation to you to come and visit the facility and consider having this interesting workshop with us.

I have attached the presentation about this workshop so you can learn more about it.

Thank you so much! Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
